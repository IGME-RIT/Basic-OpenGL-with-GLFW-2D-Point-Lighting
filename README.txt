Welcome to the Point Lighting 2D Tutorial!
Prerequesites: Normal Map 2D

Compare the direction of a pixel's normal
to the direction from the point, to the light.
If there is no difference, the pixel is bright,
if there is a difference, the pixel is dark.

This is similar to how it was done in 3D, except easier
Keep in mind that the "more graphics" section is a prerequisite
before starting the 2D spritebatch section
